Example code for f,f3,get_likelihood,and AIC is in test.m.
Example code for create_data_structure,create_data_generator,and sample_a_ranking is in main.m.

f3 or f can be used to calculate likelihood of a ranking when the number of lotteries is three.
when the number of lotteries is not three, f should be used. Both of them use trapz.
